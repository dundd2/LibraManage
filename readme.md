# LibraManage

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Library Management System developed using Python and Tkinter. I undertook the project as a personal endeavour to enhance my programming skills and create a functional application that can be used to manage library operations efficiently. The system includes user authentication, book management, member management, and transaction handling features.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with password hashing.
- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and search for books.
- **Member Management**: Add, update, delete, and search for library members.
- **Transaction Handling**: Issue and return books, and track loan history.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface using Tkinter.
- **Data Persistence**: SQLite database for storing all data.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging.
